In advance, sorry for a crowded Demo method. Typically I keep it small and cute, I was just
saving that for when we go to the next stage. 

I was able to gather a lot of information regarding the various data structures I used.
I did not time removal, as I figured it seemed redundant as long as I tested insertion and then finding.
If I can find the value fast, I can remove just as fast. 

It seems for the trails, the TreeSet is slightly more efficient in speed for insert and finding compared to the TreeMap.
This could be an error from how I setup the TreeMap for the trails, but I couldn't figure it out. Regardless, one major benefit
to the TreeMap is that I can have trails with duplicate names so long as their ID numbers are different, since I'm sure there's
trails in the world named the same, just in different locations. Both were extremely efficient, with Big O of log(n).

For the users, weirdly enough the TreeMap overtook the TreeSet. Again, the difference was miniscule, so it could've been just an error
in how I wrote them out made one slightly less efficient. I really like the TreeMaps for the user's though, as it will ensure
every username is unique, much like real world applications. The big O was at least log(n) for the insert and find.

Lastly, I only tested one data structure for the hiking history, as it seems a really good fit with benefits over others similar
to it. I decided on a Linked List, as I can maintain the order it's entered in, and let's say a hiker wants to remove or search
the List for a hike in specific, they would have that option. Compared to a queue or stack which also preserve order but
are much more difficult to traverse and remove from, this just seems more advantageous and suitable for the user's needs. 
Searching can be slow, at O(n), which isn't the best, but insertion and deletion come in at O(1).

Also, I decided against using any hash data structures, as the project outline stated that we needed to choose a data structure
that didn't require size declaration. TreeMap and TreeSet, as well as LinkedList all accomplish this in their respective uses
that I applied them to. With all of these structures and comparators, a user can search through the different trails or their hiking history 
in a multitude of ways. I feel confident with these data structures.
